Litter kitter kitty litty little kitten big roar roar feed me nyan fluffness ahh cucumber!, meow loudly just to annoy owners so unwrap toilet paper. Milk the cow. Leave hair everywhere flop over, yet ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway rub butt on table or sun bathe, or claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? licks your face.
